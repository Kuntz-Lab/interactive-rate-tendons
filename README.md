# Tendon Experiments

This repository is to contain the code for running experiments with
tendon-driven continuous robots.

## Goal

The goal of this work is

- Faster forward kinematic computations
- Apply a motion planner in a simulated environment

## Development Environment

The documentation for the development environment is stored within automation
script that generates the development environment with a docker container.
You can follow the directions manually to generate an environment directly on
your computer.

- Docker: scripts are `docker/Dockerfile*`.  Read [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)
