/**
 * Defines macro variables populated through CMake's configure_file() command.
 *
 * The configured file will be at <build-dir>/include/tendon/config.h and
 * installed normally alongside the rest of the header files.
 *
 * This file was first created to allow for the use of the 3rdparty library
 * libros2qt with qt_executor.h.  That file has some different logic in its
 * header file based on the version of ROS2's rclcpp library and has been
 * modified to work with the TENDON_RCLCPP_VERSION_MAJOR macro, if present.
 *
 * Other variables may be added as deemed necessary.
